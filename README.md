# Mobile Flashcards

## Intro
This application was built using React native. Its purpose is to act as a flashcards memory aid for those learning something. It will allow the user to create a deck to which they can
add a new card where each card represents a question. The user can view the answer and then mark in the system whether or not they got the question correct. A total score is taken
and on reaching the end of the deck, the user can view the percentage of correct answers they got for their current deck.

## Running the Application
In order to run the application, the user will need to have an Android phone connected or an Android simulator running on their system. Once running, npm run android should start the application. Note that when running the application you will need to have node package manager installed on your system.
